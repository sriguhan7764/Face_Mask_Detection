**Summary:**
A deep learning-powered real-time face mask detection system using OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras. The model detects faces using a pre-trained SSD detector and classifies them as “Mask” or “No Mask.”

**Features:**
- Real-time detection via webcam
- Custom-trained CNN model
- OpenCV for video streaming and visualization

**Installation & Usage:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Face_Mask_Detection.git
cd Face_Mask_Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

**Requirements (`requirements.txt`):**

```
tensorflow
opencv-python
imutils
numpy
```

> Note: Pre-trained model and face detection files are placed under `face_detector/`.
